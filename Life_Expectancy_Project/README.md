# Life Expectancy Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes life expectancy data across different countries and investigates the key factors contributing to variations in life expectancy. The analysis leverages data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations to derive insights from global life expectancy trends. 

## Dataset Information
The dataset contains country-wise life expectancy data along with several socioeconomic and health-related indicators.
Key columns include:
  - Country
  - Year
  - Life Expectancy
  - GDP
  - Income Composition of Resources
  - Schooling
  - Adult Mortality
  - HIV/AIDS Prevalence
  - BMI
  - Other health and economic indicators
  The dataset covers both developed and developing countries, allowing for a comparative analysis of life expectancy determinants.

## Methodology
### 1. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values through appropriate imputation techniques.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### 1. A world map was used to visualize global life expectancy variations. 
It highlights stark contrasts in life expectancy across different regions, with developed countries generally having higher life expectancy.

#### 2. Correlation matrix to examine the correlation between life expectancy and Socio-economic factors 
The socio-economic factors include: Schooling, Income composition of resources and GDP.

**Key Insights:** 
- Higher levels of education correlate with increased life expectancy.
- Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher life expectancy and vice versa.
- Lower-income countries generally have lower life expectancy due to limited resources and vice versa.
  
#### 3. Correlation between life expectancy and Health factors 
The health factors include: HIV/AIDS prevalence, BMI and Adult mortality.

**Key Insights:** 
- High adult mortality rates significantly reduce the average life expectancy in a country.
- HIV/AIDS prevalence negatively impacts life expectancy, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.
  
#### 4. Conducted a comparative analysis between developed and developing countries 
This analysis was done to highlight disparities in life expectancy trends in these 2 contry categories.

**Key Insights:**
- Developed countries show stable and high life expectancy rates, whereas developing nations have greater variability.
- Developed countries tend to have higher GDP and schooling years, lower prevelance of diseases like HIV/AIDS, more robust healthcare systems and better accesss to medical services due to their higher income composition of resources. This results in improved life expectancy in developed countries.
- Developing countries on the other hand tend to have lower GDP and schooling reates, high mortality rates due to inadequate healthcare infrastructure and high prevelance of infectious diseases. This correlates with reduced life expectancy in developing countries

## Conclusion
The project provides valuable insights into the major determinants of life expectancy. Policy measures aimed at improving education, healthcare accessibility, and economic conditions can significantly enhance life expectancy in lower-income regions.
Additionally, the stark contrast between developed and developing countries underscores the importance of targeted interventions to improve public health and economic growth.
